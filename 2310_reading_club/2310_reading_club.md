# Fourth Paradigm
---
## A bit unconventional "article"
---
## A bit messy in thoughts and ideas
---
## But important nevertheless
---
## *people collect a lot of ==data== and then ==reduce== this down to some number [...] in Science or Nature*
---
## *we have to do better at p==roducing tools== to support the whole research cycle*
---
# Science paradigms
---
### Empirical science
### Theoretical science
### Computational science
### Data exploration
---
# Context
---
# Data
## Captured by instrument
## Processed by software
## Stored in computers
### *Then the scientist looks at it*
---
## *The techniques and technologies for such data-intensive science are so different that it is worth distinguishing data-intensive science from computational science as a new, ==fourth paradigm== for scientific exploration*
---
## revolution in scientific communication
---
## public domain?
## *no thanks*
---
## funders force scientists to publish data
---
# unified publishing model
## data published alongside the paper
### code published alongside the paper
---
# reproducibility!
---
## *You’ve done some science, and you want to ==publish== it.*
---
## *How do you publish it so that others can read it and ==reproduce your results== in a hundred years’ time? *
---
## *Mendel ==did this==, and Darwin did this, but barely.*
---
## *We are now further ==behind== than Mendel and Darwin in terms of techniques to do this.* 
---
## *It’s a mess, and we’ve got to work on this problem.*
---
## almost everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology
---
## *The goal is to have a world in which all of the science ==literature is online==, all of the science ==data is online==, and they ==interoperate== with each other.*

# Qs
---
### The talk is from 2007. Is it still relevant, 16 years later?
---
### Have we managed to fulfil the goals outlined by Jim Gray?
---
### Why not?
---
### Is ==data exploration== a fourth paradigm of science?
---
### Is your science open?
---
### Is your science reproducible?
---
### How impactful is information technology to your field? What do you do about it?
