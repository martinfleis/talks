## What is geographic data science?
Geographic data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines concepts, theories, and methods from geography, computer science, statistics, and data science to study spatial and spatiotemporal phenomena.

Geographic data scientists work with a variety of spatial datasets, including satellite imagery, geographic information systems (GIS) data, and location-based data from sensors and mobile devices. They use computational tools and techniques to explore, analyze, and visualize these datasets to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights about the spatial world.

Geographic data science can be applied to a wide range of topics, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, epidemiology, transportation, and social inequality. It plays a critical role in decision-making processes for government, non-profit organizations, and businesses, as it provides a data-driven understanding of spatial phenomena and supports evidence-based policy-making.
