# A novel model blah blah blah

## ... solved a problem that did not exist in the first place.

### many researchers seem to come up with problems that ==do not exist==, ==have been solved== already, or ==do not matter== at all
--- 
### researchers often provide a solution that may solve that specific and narrow problem
---
### one may wonder if we are changing our research interest based on availability of data, capability of computers and development of new models and methods
---
#### The vast majority of submissions in our field seem to be either a problem that was essentially solved 20 years ago (or more) and compare one algorithm (“a novel blah blah blah”) with another algorithm that is generally not the state of the art. Or whatever is fashionable (often machine learning these days) and apply it without thinking about what the best way is actually of solving the relevant problem.

# Streetlight effect

### ‘If you cannot measure it, then it is not science’
---
### the illusion of knowing something or generating knowledge by just accruing some measurements
---
### we are ‘drowning in data but starving for insights’

### 1. Solving problems that either do not exist or do not matter, what we call the ‘==streetlight effect==’.

The streetlight effect refers to the story of policeman who sees a man searching for his keys under a streetlight and tries to help by looking for the keys under the streetlight with him. After a few minutes with no success, the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them there, and the man replies, no, that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks then why he is searching there, and the man replies, ‘This is where the light is!’

### We find solutions for problems that do not exist.
---
### 2. Changing the course of scientific method and framing our research questions based on what we can do and not necessarily what we should.
---
### The ubiquity of data results in our being able to convolute ‘expressing with numbers’ with ‘making measurements’. 
---
### They are not the same.
---
### One should not look for results and patterns wherever data can be found simply because data already exist.

# Do we solve the problems that are already solved or do not exist/matter? 
---
# Do we use fancy machine learning and artificial intelligence blindly just ‘because we can’? 
---
# Do we look for presentable and ‘statistically significant’ results, regardless of validity of the methods? 
---
# Do we appreciate what model can say and what can't do?
