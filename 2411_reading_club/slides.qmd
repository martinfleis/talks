### Research questions

1. How much does the operationalization of space matter for segregation measurement?
2. If differences exist between Euclidean and network measures, are they
large enough that they cannot be attributed to chance?
3. What characteristics of the travel
network are related to the observed difference in measurement?

### The spatial information theory index $\widetilde{H}$ as a measure of segregation

> the index $\widetilde{H}$ is a measure of how much less diverse individuals’ local environments are, on average, than is the total population of region

>reaches its maximum of 1 only when“each individual’s local
environment is monoracial.”

> [...] we index locations as $i$ and $j$, and we operationalize the concept of spatial relationships
using a spatial weights matrix $W$.

::: {.fragment}
> By focusing on W, we are forced“to specify
[our] underlying assumptions about socio-spatial proximity,”
:::

::: {.fragment}
> Conceptually, the spatial weights matrix $W$ reflects the
connectivity graph for the spatial relationship between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the values $w_{ij}$ encode the
intensity of the association $\overline{ij}$.

>  The local environment for a given feature y at location i can then
be measured by its spatial lag, SL, defined as

$$
SL_i = \sum_j w_{ij} y_j

> To compute Euclidean-based spatial segregation measures, our distances are
measured between block group centroids;

we first attach the block group centroids to the nearest intersection in the travel network, then
compute the shortest network-based path between each pair of observations.

> two different
spatial weights matrices by varying the way distance is measured

::: {.fragment}
> the proximity-weighting function $\phi$ is a simple linear decay (triangular kernel) encoding a
spatial weight that decreases with distance up to a threshold of 2 km

$$
\phi =
\begin{cases}
1 - \left(\frac{d_{ij}}{r}\right), & \text{if } d_{ij} \leq r, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.

network-based segregation measures that is significant at the $α = 0.05$ level, and 14.2% of the
CBSAs are significant at the $α = 0.01$ level.

### Writing

- Methods and results presented together based on topics (metric difference / network structure).

- peaks to the audicence - could be significantly more technical but the field is not used
to complex spatial modelling.

- Visuals supporting the narrative, not necessarily showing the reusults only.
